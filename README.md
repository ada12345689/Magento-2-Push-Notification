# Magento-2-Push-Notification

Magento 2 push notifications extension enables to increase customer interaction and invites upsell opportunities by displaying real-time web notifications. 

eCommerce merchants have plenty of options to advertise important messages in front of the customers. They can send a promotional email or circulate it over social media platforms or send notifications. The promotional emails go into the spam folder. Sharing on social media can also go into vain as it might happen that your important updates are neglected by the customers. While with push notifications, there is absolutely no way of going into spam or omitting. Customers can approve the notifications at the click of a button. Once they approve, all the important store notifications will be displayed to them. Push notifications help to repeat purchases from their existing customers. To avail of all the push notifications features, MageComp has launched a fully comprehensive module named Magento 2 Push Notifications.
